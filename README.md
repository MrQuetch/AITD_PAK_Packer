# AITD (1992): Pak Packer
This is a program to pack uncompressed Alone in the Dark (1992) files into PAK files. It is used mainly for modding the original game. More specifically, the main model files (for Edward Carnby). Once the new file has been created, it can be replaced with the original game file.

The compressed files were extracted (in uncompressed form) from the game using Luigi Auriemma's QuickBMS scripts from the https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm website. Using the AITD files listed here, everything else can be retrieved in pure binary. That being said, these should work for AITD 2 and 3. Though, they have not been tested.

These model files are already used in this program and are game ready. Right now, only a hex editor can be used to edit the models and no documentation exists - as far as I'm aware. So, be careful when editing files, as you will want to proceeed with caution, and want no more or less model files than what already exist in the model's folder. Otherwise, the game may crash at unuexpected moments.

This has only been written, compiled, and tested on Windows 10 with Dev-C++ version 5.11. If you plan to port it to other operating systems in other languages, please do - just be sure to let me know. I don't know much about licensing, but all permission to port is welcome.
